<div><h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><p>Tries to move the given boundary to the start of line, skipping over any
unrendered nodes, or if that fails to the end of line (after a br element
if present), and for the last line in a block, to the very end of the
block.</p>

<p>If the selection is inside a block with only a single empty line (empty
except for unrendered nodes), and both boundary points are normalized,
the selection will be collapsed to the start of the block.</p>

<p>For some operations it's useful to think of a block as a number of lines,
each including its respective br and any preceding unrendered whitespace
and in case of the last line, also any following unrendered whitespace.</p></div>
