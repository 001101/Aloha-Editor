<div class="description"><p>Serializes a DOM node to an XHTML string.</p>

<p>Beware that the serialization method will generate XHTML as close as
possible to the DOM tree represented by the given node. The result will
only be valid XHTML if the DOM tree doesn't violate any contained-in
rules.</p>

<p>Element attributes with an empty string as value will not appear in the
serialized output.</p>

<p>Element attribute names are case-insensitive in HTML5, so they may come
out in mixed-case depending on what the browser provides.</p>

<p>When iterating over the DOM, CDATA sections are comment nodes on some
browsers (Chrome) and not there at all on others (IE).  This is the same
as what comes out from element.innerHTML.</p>

<p>IE8 bug: comments will sometimes be silently stripped inside
contentEditable=true. Conditional includes don't work inside
contentEditable=true. See the tests for more information.</p>

<p>IE8 bug: a title element will not be serialized correctly unless it
occurs in the head of a HTML document, even if it occurs in a non-HTML
namespace (maybe it works with a prefix).  This will probably also apply
for other HTML elements that occur in the header.</p>

<p>IE8 bug: unrecognized elements in the HTML scope will cause broken DOM
structure (some HTML5 elements that are not yet implemented in IE for
example). Some effort was made to fix a broken DOM structure, if it is
encountered. There is one case which results in an unrecoverably broken
DOM structure, which is an unrecognized element not preceded by some
text. See the tests for further information.</p>

<p>IE8 bug: whitespace is not reliably preserved when the style
white-space:pre (or similar) is used. See the tests for further
information. Whitespace inside <pre> elements will be preserved, but \n
characters will become \r characters.</p>

<p>IE7 bug: URLs in href and src attributes of a and img elements will be
absolutized (including hostname and protocol) if they are given as a
relative path.</p>

<p>IE bug: Namespace support inside contentEditable=true is a bit shaky on
IE. Don't use it if possible. See the tests to get an idea of what seems
to work. Make namespace prefixes and element names all lower-case, as
they are always lower-cased, even if the element doesn't occur in an HTML
namespace. Don't use default namespaces, use prefixes (except for an HTML
namespace).</p></div>
