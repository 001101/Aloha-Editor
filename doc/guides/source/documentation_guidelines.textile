h3. Rendering API documentation

We use JSDoc syntax for the API documentation. This documentation is meant for programmers and implementors
as a reference of the code. General explanations and high-level overviews should go into the guides.

NOTE: We are waiting for JSDoc 3 that will offer support for RequireJS modules, for now we use the
"SproutCore Documentation Generator":https://github.com/sproutcore/docs that understands most of our
annotations.

The actual documentation is rendered using the "SproutCore Documentation Generator" in short @sc-docs@.

h4. Installation of sc-docs

Requirements:

* Ruby 1.9 and Rubygems
* node.js (for a special jsdoc-toolkit that is bundled with sc-docs)

<shell>
gem install sc-docs
</shell>

h4. Generating the documentation

A *preview* with an embedded server can be used to preview the API documentation. Run this in the Aloha
root directory:

<shell>
sc-docs preview src/plugins/common/block/lib -v -t docs.sproutcore.com
</shell>

This will render the API documentation of the block plugin (from +src/plugins/common/block/lib+).

When *generating* the documentation, an additional output directory +output_dir+ must be specified:

<shell>
sc-docs generate src/plugins/common/block/lib -v -t docs.sproutcore.com -o output_dir
</shell>
