<div class="description"><p>Indexes descendant elements based on elem.nodeName.</p>

<p>Based on these observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On IE8, for moderate values of names.length, individual calls to
getElementsByTagName is just as fast as $root.find('name, name,
name, name').</p></li>
<li><p>On IE7, $root.find('name, name, name, name') is extemely slow
(can be an order of magnitude slower than individual calls to
getElementsByTagName, why is that?).</p></li>
<li><p>Although getElementsByTagName is very fast even on IE7, when
names.length > 7 an alternative implementation that iterates
over all tags and checks names from a hashmap (similar to how
indexByClass does it) may become interesting, but
names.length > 7 is unlikely.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This function only makes sense if the given names array has many
entries. For only one or two different names, calling $('name')
or context.getElementsByTagName(name) directly is fine (but
beware of $('name, name, ...') as explained above).</p>

<p>The signature of this function differs from indexByClass by not
taking a map but instead an array of names.</p></div>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code class="plain">root – {DOMObject} – </code>
<p>The root element to search for elements to index (will not be
included in search).</p></li>
<li><code class="plain">names – {Array[String]} – </code>
<p>An array of element names to look for.
Names must be in all-uppercase (the same as elem.nodeName).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Returns">Returns</h2>
<div class="returns"><code class="plain">{Object}</code>
– <p>A map from element name to an array of elements with that name.
Names will be all-uppercase.
Arrays will be proper arrays, not NodeLists.  Every entry in
classMap for which elements have been found will have a
corresponding entry in the returned map. Entries for which no
elements have been found, may or may not have an entry in the
returned map.</p></div>
