CSS style set.</p></div>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code class="plain">styleName – {String} – </code>
<p>a CSS style name.
Please note that not-inherited styles currently may (or
may not) cause undesirable results.  See also
html.isStyleInherited().</p>

<p>The underline style can't be unformatted inside a
non-clearable ancestor ("text-decoration: none" doesn't do
anything as the underline will be drawn by the ancestor).</p></li>
<li><code class="plain">opts – {Object} – </code>
<p>all options supported by wrapElem() as well as the following:
createWrapper - a function that takes a style value and
returns a new empty wrapper node that has the style value
applied.</p>

<p>isPrunable - a function that returns true if a given node,
after some style was removed from it, can be removed
entirely. That's usually the case if the given node is
equivalent to an empty wrapper.</p>

<p>isStyleEqual - a function that returns true if two given
style values are equal.
TODO currently we just use strict equals by default, but
     we should implement for each supported style it's own
     equals function.</p></li>
</ul>
