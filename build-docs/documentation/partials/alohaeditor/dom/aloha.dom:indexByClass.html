<div class="description"><p>Indexes descendant elements based on the individual classes in
the class attribute.</p>

<p>Based on these observations;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$('.class1, .class2') takes twice as long as $('.class1') on IE7.</p></li>
<li><p>$('.class1, .class2') is fast on IE8 (approx the same as
$('.class'), no matter how many classes), but if the individual
elements in the result set should be handled differently, the
subsequent hasClass('.class1') and hasClass('.class2') calls
slow things down again.</p></li>
<li><p>DOM traversal with elem.firstChild elem.nextSibling is very
slow on IE7 compared to just iterating over
root.getElementsByTagName('*').</p></li>
<li><p>$('name.class') is much faster than just $('.class'), but as
soon as you need a single class in classMap that may be present
on any element, that optimization doesn't gain anything since
then you have to examine every element.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This function will always take approx. the same amount of time
(on IE7 approx. equivalent to a single call to $('.class')) no
matter how many entries there are in classMap to index.</p>

<p>This function only makes sense for multiple entries in
classMap. For a single class lookup, $('.class') or
$('name.class') is fine (even better in the latter case).</p></div>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code class="plain">root – {DOMObject} – </code>
<p>The root element to search for elements to index (will not be
included in search).</p></li>
<li><code class="plain">classMap – {Object} – </code>
<p>A map from class name to boolean true.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Returns">Returns</h2>
<div class="returns"><code class="plain">{Object}</code>
– <p>A map from class name to an array of elements with that class.
Every entry in classMap for which elements have been found will
have a corresponding entry in the returned map.  Entries for
which no elements have been found, may or may not have an entry
in the returned map.</p></div>
