			<p>
				Here come our first breaking changes of 2015! Yes, we've been
				busy.
			</p>

			<p>
				We're releasing API improvements that are summed up in the
				introduction of <a href="/api/ui.html">aloha.ui</a> as a core
				API module. Along with these changes, we've also freshened-up
				the design of the website and created
				<a href="http://aloha-editor.org/ui.html">new guides</a> to help
				you better along. We hope you're inspired!
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				 A good library should not dictate application-level wiring
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				The goal of these efforts was to provide a better API for wiring
				UI with Aloha Editor. Our vision of what an editing library
				should be is that a good library should not dictate
				application-level wiring. As developers who work in increasingly
				complex UI applications, you'll most probably have had the pain
				of dealing with libraries that assume an architectural
				convention or force a design on your system. The result of this
				presumtion is often as many new problems being introduced by the
				library as were solved by it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a href="/api/ui.html">aloha.ui</a> is designed in light of
				these considerations. We want Aloha Editor to be as conservative
				as possible with the assumptions it makes about the design of
				your application. To that end, we put no requirement on the
				structure of the markup whatsoever&mdash;there are no mandatory
				classes, attributes, or elements types; there is no dictated way
				to do event binding; no lifecycles; and certainly no hidden
				shared state!
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="/api/ui.html">aloha.ui</a> is designed to give the API
				consumer the flexibility to define and generate UI elements
				exactly when and how they want or need them.
				What <a href="/api.ui.html">aloha.ui</a> provides are just
				relatively generic convenient functions and objects that would
				serve to help you with wiring.
			</p>

			<p>
				These represent <i>breaking changes</i>. View the source of this
				<a href="view-source:http://www.alohaeditor.org/demo/aloha-ui/index.html">demo</a>
				to see how <a href="/api/ui.html">aloha.ui</a> was used to replaced the
				old implementation. Use this example, and the <a href="/docs">new docs</a>
				to update your own implementation.
			</p>
