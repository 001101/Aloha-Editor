h3. What are Aloha Editor Blocks?

*Aloha Editor Blocks* (Blocks) are non-editable areas of a website, which have some properties being editable
through the Aloha Editor user interface. Blocks can appear inside editables or outside editables, both
inside inline elements and inside block-level elements.

Blocks themselves can contain editables and other blocks.

Some use cases for blocks include:

* Displaying a vCard of a person from an address book.
* Displaying product prices in continuous text. Here, the user should not be able to edit the prices.
* Provide "templates" like a two-column block


h3. Using Aloha Editor Blocks

*Aloha Editor BLocks* is implemented as a plugin called @block@, which is part of the @common@ bundle.

Thus, in order to use blocks, you need to load the +common/block+ and +common/contenthandler+ plugin (Blocks interact
with the contenthandler plugin).

After the plugin is loaded, you can create blocks.

<javascript>
jQuery('.some-selector').alohaBlock();
</javascript>
