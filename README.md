Aloha Editor
============

Aloha Editor is meant to be an free and open source for all now and in future.

We encourage continuous, selfsustainable development supported by both the open source  
community and commercial stakeholders. This way both parties (community and commercial users)
profit from each other by code and financial ressources for core developement.
Therefore we adopted a dual licensing approach for Aloha Editor.
