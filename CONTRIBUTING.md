### Contributor Guidelines

Sign the Contributor License Agreement

Very important, before we can accept your code into our repository, we will need you to sign the Aloha Editor contributor license agreement (CLA). Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests. In order to read and sign the CLA, please go to:

Make sure to stick to our **[Commit Checklist](https://github.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/wiki/Commit-Checklist)** or your changes most likely won't make it :)
