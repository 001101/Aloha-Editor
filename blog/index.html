				Aloha Editor has been around for quite some time now. In 2009
				we've introduced an editor, that took a different approach and
				freed content creators from the narrow box of iframes and
				textareas. We've added a lot of plugins and features, and made
				Aloha Editor an interesting choice on the market.
			</p>
			<p>
				What we did not achieve however, is our vision. Like textareas
				for editors we were bound by the narrow constraints of
				contentEditable and the execCommand API. An API that was
				introduced over a decade ago, that is broken and limited in
				functionality. An API, that was never fully specified, and yet
				has made it's way into myriads of applications. It's broad
				adoption has finally sealed it's demise as it keeps browser
				vendors from fixing it today. The Selection API provided by
				browsers is a black box, with pitfalls and edge cases lurking
				around every corner.  Working with Ranges is extremely
				difficult, as the API is stateful and limiting.
				<br><br>
				Basing your editor on contentEditable means that you have to
				clean up the broken mess of markup the browser leaves behind.
				Every big editor with wide adoption works exactly that way. It's
				basically like babysitting a caffeinated lemming. We think that
				this is the wrong approach. Why would you want to fix something
				if you can get it right in the first place?
				<br><br>
				This is why we came up with Aloha Editor 2. We provide you
				capabilities to create editing experiences embedded seamlessly
				in your web application. With a stateless API, that was built to
				give you full control. An API that is easy to use, so you can
				craft the best experience possible for your users.
