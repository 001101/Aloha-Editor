- **MANUAL CHANGE**: Changed the meaning of a setting
                     Aloha.settings.plugins.table.summaryinsidebar

                     This setting decided whether the summary was
                     displayed either in the side bar or in the
                     floating-menu. This setting now only decides
                     whether or not a summary is displayed in the
                     sidebar.

                     The table-plugin defines a component with the name
                     tableSummary. It is up to the toolbar configuration
                     whether or not this component is displayed in the
                     toolbar.

                     For further information see the setting
                     Aloha.settings.toolbar
