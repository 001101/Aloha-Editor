<div class="description"><p>Marks an element as a ephemeral, excluding subnodes.</p>

<p>The element will be removed when the prune function is called on it, but
any children of the wrapper element will remain in its place.</p>

<p>A wrapper is an element that wraps a single non-ephemeral element. A
filler is an element that is wrapped by a single non-ephemeral element.
This distinction is not important for the prune function, which behave
the same for both wrappers and fillers, but it makes it easier to build
more advanced content inspection algorithms (also see note at the header
of ephemeral.js).</p>

<p>Adds the class 'aloha-ephemera-wrapper' to the given element.</p>

<p>The class 'aloha-ephemera-wrapper' may also be added directly, without
recurse to this function, if that is more convenient.</p>

<p>NB: a wrapper element must not wrap a filler element. Wrappers and
    fillers are ephermeral. A wrapper must always wrap a single
    <em>non-ephemeral</em> element, and a filler must always fill a single
    <em>non-ephemeral</em> element.</p></div>
